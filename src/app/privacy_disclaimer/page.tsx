                    <p>
                        Futures and forex trading contains substantial risk and is not for every investor. An investor could potentially lose all or more than the initial investment. Risk capital is money that can be lost without jeopardizing your financial security or lifestyle. Only risk capital should be used for trading and only those with <br /> sufficient risk capital should consider trading. Past performance is not necessarily indicative of future results

                        Hypothetical performance results have many significant performance and other limitations, some of which are described below.

                    <p>
                        Hypothetical or Simulated performance results have certain limitations. Unlike an actual performance record, simulated results do not represent actual trading. Also, because the trades have not actually been executed, the results may have under-or-over compensated for the impact, if any, of certain market factors, such as lack of liquidity.
                        <br />
                        <br />
                        Simulated trading programs, in general, are also subject to the fact that they are designed with the benefit of hindsight. No representation is being made that any account will or is likely to achieve profit or losses similar to those shown.
